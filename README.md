# AES256_Python

Step 1: Install the cryptography library
You can install the cryptography library using pip:

pip install cryptography

How It Works:
Key Derivation:
The derive_key function uses the Scrypt key derivation function (KDF) to generate a secure key from a password and a random salt. Scrypt is chosen for its resistance to brute-force attacks.
Encryption:
A random salt and initialization vector (IV) are generated.
The file content is read, padded to ensure it aligns with the AES block size, and then encrypted.
The salt, IV, and encrypted data are written to the output file.
Decryption:
The salt and IV are extracted from the encrypted file.
The key is derived again using the same password and salt.
The data is decrypted, unpadded, and then written to the output file.
Security Considerations:
Password Strength: Ensure that the password used for encryption is strong and difficult to guess.
Key Storage: In a real-world application, you should securely manage and store the password and keys.
You can modify the file paths and password according to your needs.
